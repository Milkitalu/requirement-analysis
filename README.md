# Requirement Analysis in Software Development.

Requirement analysis is a process that helps define what users expect from a software application or product and is a key part of a project's success. It involves several tasks, including: 

•**Identifying stakeholders**: Identifying the key users and stakeholders involved in the project 

•	**Capturing requirements**: Gathering the needs and objectives of all stakeholders 

•	**Categorizing requirements**: Organizing the requirements into categories 

•	**Interpreting requirements**: Analyzing the requirements and documenting them 

•	**Validating requirements**: Gathering stakeholder validation and getting the project signed of




## 1. What is Requirement Analysis?
**Software requirement analysis** simply means complete studying, analyzing, and describing software requirements so that requirements that are genuine and needed can be fulfilled to solve problems. 

Activities involved in analyzing Software requirements. 

 **1. Problem Recognition**: 
The main aim of requirement analysis is to fully understand the main objective of requirement that includes why it is needed, does it add value to product, will it be beneficial, does it increase quality of the project, does it have any other effect. All these points are fully recognized in problem recognition so that requirements that are essential can be fulfilled to solve business problems. 
 
**2. Evaluation and Synthesis** : 
Evaluation means judgement about something whether it is worth or not and synthesis means to create or form something. Here are some tasks are given that is important in the evaluation and synthesis of software requirement : 

•To define all the functions of software that are necessary.

•To define all data objects that are present externally and are easily observable.

•To evaluate that flow of data is worth it or not.

•To fully understand overall behavior of system that means overall working of system.

•To identify and discover constraints that are designed.

•To define and establish character of system interface to fully understand how system interacts with two or more components or with one another.

**3. Modeling**: 
After complete gathering of information from above tasks, functional and behavioral models are established after checking function and behavior of system using a domain model that also known as the conceptual model. 

 
**4. Specification**: 
The software requirement specification (SRS) which means to specify the requirement whether it is functional or non-functional should be developed. 
 
**5.Review**: 
After developing the SRS, it must be reviewed to check whether it can be improved or not and must be refined to make it better and increase the quality. 


## 2.Why is Requirement Analysis Important? ##


**Requirements analysis is important** because it helps ensure that a project meets the needs of the customer, is delivered on time and within budget, and has few or no faults. It also helps to reduce rework, improve communication, and increase consumer satisfaction. 

**Here are some benefits of requirements analysis**:

**• Define user needs** - Requirements analysis helps software engineers understand what the user needs early in the development process. 

**• Prioritize requirements** -
Requirements analysis helps organizations align their development process with business goals, so they can prioritize the requirements that have the most impact.

**• Identify key stakeholders** -
Requirements analysis helps identify the people in an organization who will be affected by the project outcome. 

**• Analyze feasibility** -
Requirements analysis helps determine a product's reliability and identify any major problems. 

**• Reduce ambiguities** -
Requirements analysis helps reduce ambiguities and misunderstandings, which can lead to project delays or failures. 

**• Resolve conflicts** -
Requirements analysis helps resolve conflicting requirements by consulting primary stakeholders and performing scenario analysis.

## 3. Key Activities in Requirement Analysis ##

Requirement analysis is the process of defining user expectations for a new or modified software product. It's also known as requirements engineering, requirements gathering, or requirements capturing.

Requirement analysis is a team effort that involves the following key activities:

**•Requirement Gathering**
Requirements gathering is a process that helps define the needs of a project and the resources needed to complete it. It's a critical step in the development of a product or service and can be applied to any project, from designing a sailboat to remodeling a bathroom.

**•Requirement Elicitation**
In requirements engineering, requirements elicitation is the practice of researching and discovering a system's requirements from users, customers, and other stakeholders. 

**•Requirement documentation**
Requirement documentation in software engineering is the systematic process of documenting all necessary information related to a software project's requirements. It serves as a single source of truth for project stakeholders, including product managers, software testers, and developers.

•	Requirement analysis and modeling 
Requirement analysis and modeling is a process that involves identifying, analyzing, and documenting the needs of stakeholders for a system or product: 

**•Requirement analysis**

The process of identifying and documenting the needs of stakeholders for a system or product. This includes defining project objectives, capturing requirements, and categorizing them. 

**•Requirement modeling**

The process of identifying the requirements that a system or product must meet to solve a business problem. Requirements are divided into functional and non-functional. 

**•Requirements analysis models**

Visual representations of business needs, problems, and solutions that help communicate, validate, and verify requirements. Effective models are complete, consistent, clear, accurate, and testable. 
The process of requirement analysis and modeling typically involves the following steps:
1.	Identify key stakeholders and end-users
2.	Define project objectives
3.	Capture requirements
4.	Categorize requirements
5.	Interpret and record requirements
6.	Model the requirements
7.	Gather stakeholder validation
8.	Get the project signed off

**•Requirement Validation.**

Requirement validation is the process of confirming that written requirements match the requests of stakeholders. It's important to ensure that requirements are of high quality, clearly define the customer's needs, and are sufficient for the implementation teams to design and implement the product. 
Here are some things to consider when performing requirement validation:

    •Check for clarity: Are the requirements stated clearly? 

    •Check against the original source: Has the requirement been examined against the original source? 

    •Check for quantitative terms: Is the requirement bounded in quantitative terms? 
    •Use a checklist: It can be useful to examine each requirement against a set of checklist questions 
    •Use prototyping: Present a basic working model of the system to the end-user so they can test and experiment with it 
Requirement validation is different from verification, which is the process of checking that the software meets specifications.

Ensuring that the requirements are well-formed, unambiguous, complete, consistent, correct, feasible, and verifiable 


## 4. Types of Requirements ##


**Software Requirements are mainly classified into three types:**

1. Functional requirements

2. Non-functional requirements

3. Domain requirements

**1. Functional Requirements.**

Functional requirements specify the actions that the software needs to perform. These are the basic features and functionalities that users expect from the software.

**Examples:**

•	User Authentication: The system must allow users to log in using a username and password.

•	Search Functionality: The software should enable users to search for products by name or category.

•	Report Generation: The system should be able to generate sales reports for a specified date range.


**2. Non-functional Requirements**

Non-functional requirements describe how the software performs a task rather than what it should do. They define the quality attributes, performance criteria, and constraints.

Non-functional requirements are about the system’s behavior, quality, and constraints. They ensure that the software meets certain standards of performance, usability, reliability, and security.

**Examples:**

•	Performance: The system should process 1,000 transactions per second.

•	Usability: The software should be easy to use and have a user-friendly interface.

•	Reliability: The system must have 99.9% uptime.

•	Security: Data must be encrypted during transmission and storage.


**3. Domain Requirements**

Domain requirements reflect the unique needs and constraints of a particular industry. They ensure that the software is relevant and compliant with industry-specific regulations and standards. They include terminology, rules, and standards relevant to that particular domain.


**Examples:** 

•  Healthcare: The software must comply with HIPAA regulations for handling patient data.

• Finance: The system should adhere to GAAP standards for financial reporting.

•	E-commerce: The software should support various payment gateways like PayPal, Stripe, and credit cards.

## 5. Use Case Diagrams. ##

**A Use Case Diagram** is a visual representation that illustrates the interactions between users (actors) and a system. It captures the functional requirements of a system, showing how different users engage with various use cases, or specific functionalities, within the system. Use case diagrams provide a high-level overview of a system’s behavior, making them useful for stakeholders, developers, and analysts to understand how a system is intended to operate from the user’s perspective, and how different processes relate to one another. They are crucial for defining system scope and requirements.

It represents the interaction between actors (users or external systems) and a system under consideration to accomplish specific goals. It provides a high-level view of the system's functionality by illustrating the various ways users can interact with it.

**Use case diagrams have several advantages, including:**

    • User-centric design 

    Use case diagrams help businesses and software developers design processes from the user's perspective. This can lead to a system that functions more efficiently and meets the user's needs. 

    •	Visual representation

    Use case diagrams can help visualize the system's flow and behavior, illustrate its functionality, and represent key user interactions. 

    •	Communication tool

    Use case diagrams can be used to simplify communication by graphically depicting a subset of a model. 

    •	Context for developers

    Use case diagrams can provide developers with context for what they are programming. 

    •	Thought structure for business analysts

    Use case diagrams can provide business analysts with a thought structure for investigating business rules.

## 6. Define Acceptance Criteria ##

**Acceptance criteria refer to a set of predetermined requirements that have to be fulfilled for a user story to be considered finished. ** These are also sometimes called the “definition of done” because they define the parameters and requirements that developers must meet in order for the user story to be regarded as complete. It act as a pass/fail checklist that defines the success of the product or a feature from an end-user perspective.
Acceptance criteria are typically a collaborative effort between the product owner and the development team. The product owner is responsible for providing business context and requirements, while the development team contributes technical insights. Together, they define it as it meet both business and technical needs.

**Importance of Acceptance Criteria**

    Here are the following acceptance criteria mentioned below:

    1.	Define Expectations: Clearly outline what needs to be accomplished for a user story or feature to be considered done.

    2.	Communication: Facilitate effective communication between development teams, product owners, and stakeholders, ensuring everyone is on the same page.

    3.	Quality Assurance: Act as a quality control measure, helping to prevent misunderstandings and minimize defects.

    4.	Scope Control: Prevent scope creep by setting clear boundaries on what is and isn't part of the user story or feature.
    
    5.	Testing Guidelines: Provide guidance for writing test cases and conducting acceptance testing.

**There are different types of acceptance criteria:**

    1.	Functional: Describes the desired functionality, behavior, or features of the software.
    2.	Non-Functional: Focuses on aspects such as performance, security, usability, and scalability.
    3.	Positive: Describes the expected positive outcomes when the feature works correctly.
    4.	Negative: Outlines the behavior or outcomes when the feature fails or encounters errors.
