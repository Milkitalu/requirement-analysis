# Requirement Analysis in Software Development.

Requirement analysis is a process that helps define what users expect from a software application or product and is a key part of a project's success. It involves several tasks, including: 

•**Identifying stakeholders**: Identifying the key users and stakeholders involved in the project 

•	**Capturing requirements**: Gathering the needs and objectives of all stakeholders 

•	**Categorizing requirements**: Organizing the requirements into categories 

•	**Interpreting requirements**: Analyzing the requirements and documenting them 

•	**Validating requirements**: Gathering stakeholder validation and getting the project signed of




## 1. What is Requirement Analysis?
**Software requirement analysis** simply means complete studying, analyzing, and describing software requirements so that requirements that are genuine and needed can be fulfilled to solve problems. 

Activities involved in analyzing Software requirements. 

1.**Problem Recognition**: 
The main aim of requirement analysis is to fully understand the main objective of requirement that includes why it is needed, does it add value to product, will it be beneficial, does it increase quality of the project, does it have any other effect. All these points are fully recognized in problem recognition so that requirements that are essential can be fulfilled to solve business problems. 
 
2.**Evaluation and Synthesis** : 
Evaluation means judgement about something whether it is worth or not and synthesis means to create or form something. Here are some tasks are given that is important in the evaluation and synthesis of software requirement : 

•    To define all the functions of software that are necessary.

•To define all data objects that are present externally and are easily observable.

•	To evaluate that flow of data is worth it or not.

•	To fully understand overall behavior of system that means overall working of system.

•	To identify and discover constraints that are designed.

•	To define and establish character of system interface to fully understand how system interacts with two or more components or with one another.

3.**Modeling**: 
After complete gathering of information from above tasks, functional and behavioral models are established after checking function and behavior of system using a domain model that also known as the conceptual model. 

 
4.**Specification**: 
The software requirement specification (SRS) which means to specify the requirement whether it is functional or non-functional should be developed. 
 
5.**Review**: 
After developing the SRS, it must be reviewed to check whether it can be improved or not and must be refined to make it better and increase the quality. 


## 2.Why is Requirement Analysis Important? ##


**Requirements analysis is important** because it helps ensure that a project meets the needs of the customer, is delivered on time and within budget, and has few or no faults. It also helps to reduce rework, improve communication, and increase consumer satisfaction. 

**Here are some benefits of requirements analysis**:

•**Define user needs**Requirements analysis helps software engineers understand what the user needs early in the development process. 

•**Prioritize requirements**
Requirements analysis helps organizations align their development process with business goals, so they can prioritize the requirements that have the most impact.

•**Identify key stakeholders**
Requirements analysis helps identify the people in an organization who will be affected by the project outcome. 

•**Analyze feasibility**
Requirements analysis helps determine a product's reliability and identify any major problems. 

•**Reduce ambiguities**
Requirements analysis helps reduce ambiguities and misunderstandings, which can lead to project delays or failures. 

•**Resolve conflicts**
Requirements analysis helps resolve conflicting requirements by consulting primary stakeholders and performing scenario analysis.
